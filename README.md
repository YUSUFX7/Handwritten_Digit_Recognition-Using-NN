In this project, I have implemented a custom neural network to understand the mechanics of neural network comparing it to an equivalent TensorFlow Neural Network implementation. We can see that the custom neural network performed similarly to TensorFlow in terms of loss and accuracy, TensorFlow's GPU acceleration offered a significant speed advantage, making it far more efficient for larger datasets or real-time applications.

Additionally, I explored a convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate how well it performed the given task. While the CNN outperformed both the custom and TensorFlow neural networks in terms of accuracy, the computational cost was substantial, particularly on a CPU. Therefore training/predicting with a CNN was impractical for the project's requirements. Thus, while CNNs offer superior predictive performance, they were deemed overkill for this specific context.

This comparison highlights the trade-offs between customization, performance, and computational resources in neural network development.
